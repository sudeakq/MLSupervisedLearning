# Supervised Learning in Python
Welcome to the Supervised Learning in Python repository! This repository will feature projects and studies on supervised learning algorithms implemented in Python. The main goal is to understand, implement, and compare various supervised learning techniques.

## Planned Topics
The following algorithms and topics will be covered step by step in this repository. Currently, only the k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm has been implemented, but the rest will follow soon:

k-Nearest Neighbors (KNN),
Decision Trees,
Random Forest,
Logistic Regression,
Support Vector Machines (SVM),
Naive Bayes,
Comparison of Classification Algorithms,
Linear Regression,
Multiple Linear Regression,
Polynomial Regression

## Repository Contents
### 1. K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

#### KNN.py
A classification project where the load_breast_cancer dataset from the sklearn library is used. The dataset is analyzed and modeled using the KNN algorithm.

#### RegressionKNN.py
A regression-focused implementation of KNN. A custom dataset of random numbers is generated, and KNN is applied for regression tasks.

Stay tuned for updates as more algorithms and projects will be added soon!
